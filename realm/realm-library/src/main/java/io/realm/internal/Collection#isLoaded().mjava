    // The Results of Object Store will be queried asynchronously in nature. But we do have to support "sync" query by
    // Java like RealmQuery.findAll().
    // The flag is used for following cases:
    // 1. For sync query, loaded will be set to true when collection is created. So we will bypass the first trigger of
    //    listener if it comes with empty change set from Object Store since we assume user already got the query
    //    result.
    // 2. For async query, when load() gets called with loaded not set, the listener should be triggered with empty
    //    change set since it is considered as query first returned.
    // 3. If the listener triggered with empty change set after load() called for async queries, it is treated as the
    //    same case as 1).
    // TODO: Results built from a LinkView has not been considered yet. Maybe it should bet set as loaded when create.
