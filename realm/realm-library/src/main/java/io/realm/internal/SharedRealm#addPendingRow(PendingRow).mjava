    // addPendingRow, removePendingRow and executePendingRow queries are to solve that the listener cannot be added
    // inside a transaction. For the findFirstAsync(), listener is registered on an Object Store Results first, then move
    // the listeners to the Object when the query for Results returns. When beginTransaction() called, all listeners'
    // on the results will be triggered first, that leads to the registration of listeners on the Object which will
    // throw because of the transaction has already begun. So here we execute all PendingRow queries first before
    // calling the Object Store begin_transaction to avoid the problem.
    // Add pending row to the list when it is created. It should be called in the PendingRow constructor.
