     * Insert a list of an unmanaged RealmObjects. This is generally faster than {@link #copyToRealm(Iterable)} since it
     * doesn't return the inserted elements, and performs minimum allocations and checks.
     * After being inserted any changes to the original objects will not be persisted.
     * <p>
     * Please note:
     * <ul>
     * <li>We don't check if the provided objects are already managed or not, so inserting a managed object will duplicate it</li>
     * <li>We don't create (nor return) a managed {@link RealmObject} for each element</li>
     * <li>Copying an object will copy all field values. Any unset field in the object and child objects will be set to their default value if not provided</li>
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If you want these checks and the managed {@link RealmObject} returned, use {@link #copyToRealm(Iterable)}, otherwise if
     * you have a large number of object this method is generally faster.
     *
     * @param objects RealmObjects to insert.
