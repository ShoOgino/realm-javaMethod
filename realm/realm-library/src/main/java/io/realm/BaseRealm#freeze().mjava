     * Frozen data can be queried as normal, but trying to mutate it in any way or attempting to register any listener will
     * throw an {@link IllegalStateException}.

     * of the Realm. In order to avoid such a situation, it is possible to set {@link RealmConfiguration.Builder#maxNumberOfActiveVersions(long)}.
     *
     * @return a frozen copy of this Realm.
     * @throws IllegalStateException if this method is called from inside a write transaction.
