     * Freezing a collection also creates a Realm which has its own lifecycle, but if the live Realm that spawned the

     * throw an {@link IllegalStateException}.
     * <p>
     * Note: Keeping a large number of frozen collections with different versions alive can have a negative impact on the filesize
     * of the Realm. In order to avoid such a situation, it is possible to set {@link RealmConfiguration.Builder#maxNumberOfActiveVersions(long)}.
